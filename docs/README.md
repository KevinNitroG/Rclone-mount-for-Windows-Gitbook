# Rclone mount for Windows

## What's this?

* This is my way to use Rclone to mount remotes like in Linux `--daemon`

> You can read [rclone mount doc](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone\_mount/#synopsis) to know what is `--daemon` mean

## Why's this?

* When you use `rclone mount` command, you need to <mark style="color:red;">keep the cmd window open</mark>. If you <mark style="color:orange;">close it</mark>, Rclone will stop ðŸ’€
*   In this way, it doesn't show any log, cmd window and runs independently from any process
