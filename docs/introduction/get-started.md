# Get started

## Two options you can choose to mount for Windows

| Differences                        | Windows Task Scheduler | SilentCMD       |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| **Additional program**             | No                     | Yes             |
| **Easy to  setup**                 | Yes                    | No              |
| **Easy to multi remotes setup**    | No...                  | Yes             |
| **Easy to control (start / stop)** | Yes                    | Yes but **YES** |

* In fact, in [Rclone docs](https://rclone.org/install/#autostart-on-windows), there are other ways to start Rclone on Windows start, but I think these are the best and easiest way to do so
* Alternative of **SilentCMD** is [**NirCMD**](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html), you can try
* If it isn't efficient and you have another way, feel free to create an issue or create a pull request ðŸ¥°
