# Get started

## TWO OPTIONS

| Differences                                       | Windows Task Scheduler | SilentCMD       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| **Additional program**                            | No                     | Yes             |
| **Easy to  setup**                                | Yes                    | No              |
| **Easy to multi remotes setup**                   | No...                  | Yes             |
| **Easy to control (start / stop)**                | Yes                    | Yes but **YES** |
| [**Start with computer**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] | Yes                    | No              |

* In fact, in [Rclone docs](https://rclone.org/install/#autostart-on-windows), there are other ways to start Rclone on Windows start, but I think these are the best and easiest ways to do so
* An alternative of [**SilentCMD** ](https://github.com/stbrenner/SilentCMD)is [**NirCMD**](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html), you can give it a try
* If it isn't efficient and you have another way, feel free to create an issue or create a pull request ðŸ¥°

[^1]: When the computer starts, it run Rclone mount even user hasn't log on yet
