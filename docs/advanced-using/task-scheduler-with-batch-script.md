# Task Scheduler with batch script

## Explanation

* With **wireless internet connection** or even **wired internet connection**, sometimes [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") doesn't work stably _(like hasn't connected to the network before Rclone mount fails or Network doesn't have internet connection),_ which may lead to Rclone fail mounting
* With [Broken link](broken-reference "mention"), Rclone only mounts after successfully pinging to `google.com`&#x20;
